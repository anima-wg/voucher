             A Voucher Artifact for Bootstrapping Protocols
                   draft-ietf-anima-rfc8366bis-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a strategy to securely assign a Pledge to an
   Owner using an artifact signed, directly or indirectly, by the
   Pledge's manufacturer.  This artifact is known as a "Voucher".

   This document defines an artifact format as a YANG-defined JSON or
   CBOR document that has been signed using a variety of cryptographic
   systems.

   The Voucher Artifact is normally generated by the Pledge's
   manufacturer (i.e., the Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority
   (MASA)).

   This document updates RFC8366: it includes a number of desired
   extensions into the YANG module.  The Voucher Request YANG module
   defined in RFC8995 is also updated and now included in this document,
   as well as other YANG extensions needed for variants of BRSKI/
   RFC8995.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a strategy to securely assign a candidate
   device (Pledge) to an Owner using an artifact signed, directly or
   indirectly, by the Pledge's manufacturer, i.e., the Manufacturer
   Authorized Signing Authority (MASA).  This artifact is known as the
   "Voucher".

   The Voucher Artifact is a JSON [RFC8259] document that conforms with
   a data model described by YANG [RFC7950].  It may also be serialized
   to CBOR [CBOR].  It is encoded using the rules defined in [RFC7951]
   or [RFC9254], and is signed using (by default) a CMS structure
   [RFC5652].

   The primary purpose of a Voucher is to securely convey a trust anchor
   that a Pledge can use to authenticate subsequent interactions.  The
   trust anchor may be in the form of a certificate (the 'pinned-domain-
   cert' Attribute), a hash of a certificate, or it can be a raw public
   key (in constrained use cases).

   This trust anchor represents the authority of the Owner of a network.
   Communicating this trust anchor securely to the Pledge is the job of
   the Voucher Artifact.  The act of communicating this trust anchor is
   known as pinning the trust anchor, as the Pledge can then use the
   resulting anchor to authenticate other actors who are part of the
   network.  The collection of all these actors is collectively known as
   the Domain.  (This is not related to the domain name system, but
   rather the term is of mathematical origin)

   A Voucher may be useful in several contexts, but the driving
   motivation herein is to support secure Onboarding mechanisms.  This
   is accomplished by assigning an Owner to the Pledge, enabling it to
   authenticate the network that it is connected to.

   [RFC8366] originally defined the Voucher as the only Voucher
   Artifact, leaving the Voucher Request that is used in BRSKI to be
   defined in [BRSKI].  This document includes both Voucher and Voucher
   Request, and therefore updates [BRSKI].

   YANG is not easily extended except by updating the YANG module
   definition.  Since [RFC8366] was written, the common pattern is to
   publish YANG modules as two documents: one with only the YANG module,
   and the other one with usage, motivation and further explanation.
   This allows the YANG module to be updated without replacing all of
   the context.  This document does not follow that pattern, but future
   documents may update only the YANG module.

   This document introduces a mechanism to support future extensions
   without requiring the YANG module to be revised.  This includes both
   a new IETF standard mechanism for extensions modeled after the
   mechanism present in [RFC8520], as well as a facility for
   manufacturer private extensions.

   The lifetimes of Vouchers may vary.  In some Onboarding protocols,
   the Vouchers may include a nonce restricting them to a single use,
   whereas the Vouchers in other Onboarding protocols may have an
   indicated lifetime.  In order to support long lifetimes, this
   document recommends using short lifetimes with programmatic renewal,
   see Section 10.1.

   Some Onboarding protocols using the Voucher Artifact defined in this
   document include: [ZERO-TOUCH], [SECUREJOIN], [BRSKI] and [cBRSKI].

2.  Terminology

   This document uses and defines the following terms.  They are used in
   this document and related documents.

   (Voucher) Artifact:  Used throughout this document to represent a
      Voucher or Voucher Request as instantiated in the form of a signed
      datastructure.  The payload of the signed datastructure is called
      the Voucher Data.

   Attribute:  A single named data element that can be stored in Voucher
      Data.  The element's name and data type are defined by one of the
      YANG models as defined in this document.

   Bootstrapping:  The process where a Pledge obtains cryptographic key
      material to identify and trust future interactions within a
      specific Domain network.  Based on imprinted key material provided
      during the manufacturing process (see: Imprint).  This term was
      used in [RFC8366], but has been supplanted by the term Onboarding.

   Domain:  The set of entities or infrastructure under common
      administrative control.  The goal of the Onboarding protocol is to
      enable a Pledge to join a Domain and obtain domain-specific
      security credentials.  This term is not related to "DNS domain"
      [RFC9499] although a Domain might be associated to a specific DNS
      domain.

   Imprint:  The process where a device obtains the cryptographic key
      material to identify and trust future interactions generally as
      part of the manufacturing.  This term is taken from Konrad
      Lorenz's work in biology with new ducklings: "during a critical
      period, the duckling would assume that anything that looks like a
      mother duck is in fact their mother" [Stajano99theresurrecting].
      An equivalent for a device is to obtain the fingerprint of the
      manufacturer's root certification authority (root CA) certificate.
      A device that Imprints on an attacker suffers a similar fate to a
      duckling that imprints on a hungry wolf.  Imprinting is a term
      from psychology and ethology, as described in [imprinting].

   Join Registrar (and Coordinator):  A representative of the Domain
      that is configured, perhaps autonomically, to decide whether a new
      device is allowed to join the Domain.  The administrator of the
      Domain interfaces with a Join Registrar (and Coordinator) to
      control this process.  Typically, a Join Registrar is "inside" its
      Domain.  For simplicity, this document often refers to this as
      just "Registrar".

   MASA (Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority):  The entity that,
      for the purpose of this document, issues and signs the Vouchers
      for a manufacturer's Pledges and keeps logs of Pledge ownership.
      In some Onboarding protocols, the MASA may have an Internet
      presence and be integral to the Onboarding process, whereas in
      other protocols the MASA may be an offline service that has no
      active role in the Onboarding process.

   Malicious Registrar:  An on-path active attacker that presents itself
      as a legitimate Registrar.

   Onboarding:  Onboarding describes the process to provide necessary
      operational data to a Pledge and to complete the process of
      bringing the Pledge into an operational state.  This data may
      include configuration data, but specifically deals with
      application-specific cryptographic key material (application-
      specific security credentials).  Since [RFC8366], this term has
      replaced the term Bootstrapping.

   Owner:  The entity that controls the private key of the trust anchor
      conveyed by the Voucher.  Typically, the Owner is indicated by the
      'pinned-domain-cert' Attribute.

   Pledge:  The prospective component/device attempting to find and
      securely join a Domain.  When shipped or in factory reset mode, it
      only trusts authorized representatives of the manufacturer.

   Registrar:  See Join Registrar.  This term is not related to the term
      DNS Registrar [RFC9499].

   TOFU (Trust on First Use):  When a Pledge makes no security decisions
      but rather simply trusts the first Domain entity it is contacted
      by.  Used similarly to [RFC7435].  This is also known as the
      "resurrecting duckling" model [Stajano99theresurrecting].

   Voucher:  A Voucher Artifact, not a Voucher Request, that is a signed
      statement from the MASA service that indicates to a Pledge the
      cryptographic identity of the Domain it should trust.  When
      clarity is needed, it may be preceded by the type of the
      signature, such as CMS, JWS or COSE.

   Voucher Data:  The raw (serialized) representation of the YANG data
      elements of a Voucher (Request) without any enclosing signature.
      Current serialization formats include JSON and CBOR.

   Voucher Request:  A signed artifact sent from the Pledge to the
      Registrar, or from the Registrar to the MASA, for Voucher
      acquisition.  When clarity is needed, it may be preceded by the
      type of the signature, such as CMS, JWS or COSE.

   Pledge Voucher Request (PVR):  A signed artifact sent from the Pledge
      to the Registrar.  It is a specific form of Voucher Request.

   Registrar Voucher Request (RVR):  A signed artifact sent from the
      Registrar to the MASA.  It is a specific form of Voucher Request.

3.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Survey of Voucher Types

   A Voucher is a cryptographically protected statement to the Pledge
   authorizing a zero-touch Onboarding with the Join Registrar of the
   Domain.  The specific information a Voucher provides is influenced by
   the Onboarding use case.

   The Voucher can convey the following information to the Join
   Registrar and to the Pledge:

   Assertion Basis:  Indicates the method that protects the Onboarding
      (this is distinct from the Voucher signature that protects the
      Voucher itself).  Methods include manufacturer-asserted ownership
      verification, assured logging operations, or reliance on Pledge
      behavior such as secure or measured boot.  The Join Registrar uses
      this information to make a determination as to whether to accept
      the Pledge into the network.  Only some methods are normatively
      defined in this document.  Other methods are left for future work.

   Authentication of Join Registrar:  Indicates how the Pledge can
      authenticate the Join Registrar.  This document defines a
      mechanism to pin the Domain certificate, or a raw public key.
      Pinning a symmetric key, or CN-ID ([RFC6125]) or DNS-ID
      information (as defined in [RFC9525]) is left for future work.

   Anti-Replay Protections:  Time- or nonce-based information to
      constrain the Voucher to specific time periods or Onboarding
      attempts.

   A number of Onboarding scenarios can be met using differing
   combinations of this information.  All scenarios address the primary
   threat of an on-path active attacker (or MiTM) impersonating the
   Registrar.  If successful, this would gain control over the Pledge.
   The following combinations are "types" of Vouchers:

   +=========+===========+========+===========+========+========+=====+
   |Voucher  | Assertion |        | Registrar |        |Validity|     |
   |Type     |           |        |        ID |        |        |     |

   |Voucher  |           |        |           |        |        |     |

   |Nonceless|         X |        |         X |        |       X|     |
   |Audit    |           |        |           |        |        |     |
   +---------+-----------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+-----+
   |Owner    |         X |       X|         X |        |       X|    X|
   |Audit    |           |        |           |        |        |     |
   +---------+-----------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+-----+
   |Owner ID |           |       X|         X |       X|       X|     |
   |Voucher  |           |        |           |        |        |     |
   +---------+-----------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+-----+
   |Bearer   |         X |        |  wildcard |wildcard|optional|  opt|
   |Voucher  |           |        |           |        |        |     |
   +---------+-----------+--------+-----------+--------+--------+-----+

                    Table 1: Overview of Voucher types

   NOTE: The "RTC" column denotes Voucher validation using a Real-Time
   Clock.

   NOTE: All Voucher types include a "Pledge ID serial-number" (column
   not shown for space reasons).

   Audit Voucher:  An audit Voucher is named after the logging assertion
      mechanisms that the Registrar then "audits" to enforce its local
      policy.  The Registrar mitigates the risk of a Malicious Registrar
      by auditing that no unknown Registrar, or known Malicious
      Registrar, appears in the MASA's log entries for the Pledge.  This
      does not directly prevent a Malicious Registrar but provides a
      response mechanism that ensures the on-path attack is
      unsuccessful.  An advantage is that actual ownership knowledge
      (i.e., sales integration providing an indication of who purchased
      the device) is not required on the MASA service.

   Nonceless Audit Voucher:  An audit Voucher with a validity period
      statement, but no guarantee of freshness.  Fundamentally, it is
      the same as an audit Voucher except that it can be issued in
      advance to support network partitions or to provide a permanent
      Voucher for remote deployments.  Being issued in advance of the
      Pledge being online, the Pledge can not rely on a nonce to be
      included for freshness.  This compromise in reducing the freshness
      allows for the resulting Voucher to be carried across air-gapped
      infrastructure.  In addition, if the validity period has been set
      sufficiently long, the Voucher can be used after the manufacturer
      (and its delegates) has gone out of business.

   Ownership Audit Voucher:  An audit Voucher where the MASA service has
      verified the Registrar as the authorized Owner.  The MASA service
      mitigates a MiTM Registrar by refusing to generate audit Vouchers
      for unauthorized Registrars.  The Registrar uses audit techniques
      to supplement the MASA.  This provides an ideal sharing of policy
      decisions and enforcement between the vendor and the Owner.

   Ownership ID Voucher:  Named after inclusion of the Pledge's CN-ID or
      DNS-ID within the Voucher.  The MASA service mitigates a MiTM
      Registrar by identifying the specific Registrar (via PKIX
      [RFC5280]) authorized to own the Pledge.

   Bearer Voucher:  A bearer Voucher is named after the inclusion of a
      Registrar ID wildcard.  Because the Registrar identity is not
      indicated, this Voucher type must be treated as a secret and
      protected from exposure as any 'bearer' of the Voucher can claim
      the Pledge.  This variation is included in the above table in
      order to clearly show how other Voucher types differ.  This
      specification does not support bearer Vouchers at this time.
      There are other specifications in the industry which are
      equivalent though.  Publishing a nonceless bearer Voucher
      effectively turns the specified Pledge into a TOFU device with
      minimal mitigation against MiTM Registrars.  Bearer Vouchers are
      therefore out of scope.

5.  Changes since RFC8366

5.1.  Attempts and motivation to extend RFC8366

   [RFC8366] was published in 2018 during the development of [BRSKI],
   [ZERO-TOUCH] and other work-in-progress efforts.  Since then the
   industry has matured significantly, and the in-the-field activity
   which this document supports has become known as _Onboarding_ rather
   than _Bootstrapping_.

   The focus of [BRSKI] was Onboarding of ISP and Enterprise owned wired
   routing and switching equipment, with IoT devices being a less
   important aspect.  [ZERO-TOUCH] has focused upon Onboarding of CPE
   equipment like cable modems and other larger IoT devices, again with
   smaller IoT devices being of lesser importance.

   Since [BRSKI] was published there is now a mature effort to do
   application-level Onboarding of constrained IoT devices defined by
   the Thread Group and the Fairhair Alliance (now OCF) [fairhair].  The
   [cBRSKI] document has defined a version of [BRSKI] that is usable
   over constrained IEEE 802.15.4 6LoWPAN networks using CoAP and DTLS,
   while [I-D.ietf-lake-authz] provides for using CoAP and EDHOC on even
   more constrained devices with very constrained networks.

   [PRM] has created a new methodology for Onboarding that does not
   depend upon a synchronous connection between the Pledge and the
   Registrar.  This mechanism uses a mobile Registrar agent that works
   to collect and transfer signed artifacts via physical travel from one
   network to another.

   Both [cBRSKI] and [PRM] require extensions to the Voucher Request and
   the resulting Voucher.  The new Attributes are required to carry the
   additional data and describe the extended semantics.  In addition
   [cBRSKI] uses the serialization mechanism described in [RFC9254] to
   produce significantly more compact artifacts.

   When the process to define [cBRSKI] and [PRM] was started, there was
   a belief that the appropriate process was to use the [RFC7950]
   _augment_ mechanism to further extend both the Voucher Request
   [BRSKI] and Voucher [RFC8366] artifacts.  However, [PRM] needs to
   extend an enumerated type with additional values and _augment_ can
   not do this, so that was initially the impetus for this document.

   An attempt was then made to determine what would happen if one wanted
   to have a constrained version of the [PRM] Voucher Artifact.  The
   result was invalid YANG, with multiple definitions of the core
   Attributes from the [RFC8366] Voucher Artifact.  After some
   discussion, it was determined that the _augment_ mechanism did not
   work for this use case, nor did it work better when the [RFC8040]
   "yang-data" extension was replaced with the [RFC8791] "structure"
   extension.

   After significant discussion the decision was made to simply roll all
   of the needed extensions into this document.

6.  Updates to RFC8995

   This document therefore represents a merge of YANG definitions from
   [RFC8366], the Voucher Request from [BRSKI], and extensions to each
   of these from [cBRSKI], [CLOUD] and [PRM].  The difficulty with this
   approach is that the semantics of the definitions needed for the
   other documents is not included in this document, but rather in the
   respective other documents.

   The voucher-request definition that was in [BRSKI] sections 3.2 (tree
   diagram) and 3.4 (YANG module) is now included in this document.
   There is a change to the voucher-request: the idevid-issuer MUST be
   included in the Registrar Voucher Request (RVR).  Like the serial-
   number, the idevid-issuer is to be taken from client certificate.  In
   some varations of BRSKI, such as [PRM] there is no direct TLS
   connection between Pledge and Registrar.  Therefore the Pledge's
   IDevID certificate can not be extracted from the TLS connection, so
   those variations document a different channel binding process.

6.1.  Errata closed

   This above updates to [BRSKI] addresses errata [eid7263].

7.  Signature mechanisms

   Three signature systems have been defined for Vouchers Artifacts.

   [cBRSKI] defines a mechanism that uses COSE [COSE], with the Voucher
   Data encoded using [RFC9254].  However, as the SID [RFC9254]
   allocation process requires up-to-date YANG, the SID values for this
   mechanism are presented in this document.

   [jBRSKI] defines a mechanism that uses JSON [RFC8259] and [JWS].

   The CMS signing mechanism first defined in [RFC8366] continues to be
   defined here.

7.1.  CMS Format Voucher Artifact

   The IETF evolution of PKCS#7 is CMS [RFC5652].  A CMS-signed Voucher,
   the default type, contains a ContentInfo structure with the Voucher
   Data.  An OID for JSON-encoded Voucher Data is allocated in
   Section 12.4, and it is to be placed in the 'eContentType' field in
   the ContentInfo.

   The signing structure is a CMS SignedData structure, as specified by
   Section 5.1 of [RFC5652], encoded using ASN.1 Distinguished Encoding
   Rules (DER), as specified in ITU-T X.690 [ITU-T.X690.2015].

   [RFC5652] mandates that SignedAttributes MUST be present when the
   content type is not 'id-data'.  This mitigates attacks on CMS as
   described in [I-D.vangeest-lamps-cms-euf-cma-signeddata].  Decoders
   MUST verify that SignedAttributes are present.

   To facilitate interoperability, Section 12.3 the media type
   "application/voucher-cms+json" and the filename extension ".vcj" were
   registered by [RFC8366].

   The CMS structure MUST contain a 'signerInfo' structure, as described
   in Section 5.1 of [RFC5652], containing the signature generated over
   the content using a private key trusted by the recipient.  Normally,
   the recipient is the Pledge and the signer is the MASA.  In the
   Voucher Request, the signer is the Pledge (in the PVR), or the
   Registrar (in the RVR).

   Note that Section 5.1 of [RFC5652] includes a discussion about how to
   validate a CMS object, which is really a PKCS7 object (cmsVersion=1).
   Intermediate systems (such as the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key
   Infrastructures [BRSKI] Registrar) that might need to evaluate the
   Voucher in flight MUST be prepared for such an older format.  No
   signaling of the format version is necessary, as the manufacturer
   knows the capabilities of the Pledge and will use an appropriate
   format Voucher for each Pledge.

   The CMS structure SHOULD also contain all of the certificates leading
   up to and including the signer's trust anchor certificate known to
   the recipient.  The inclusion of the trust anchor is unusual in many
   applications, but third parties cannot accurately audit the
   transaction without it.

   The CMS structure MAY also contain revocation objects for any
   intermediate certificate authorities (CAs) between the Voucher issuer
   and the trust anchor known to the recipient.  However, the use of
   CRLs and other validity mechanisms is discouraged, as the Pledge is
   unlikely to be able to perform online checks and is unlikely to have
   a trusted clock source.  As described below, the use of short-lived
   Vouchers and/or a Pledge-provided nonce provides a freshness
   guarantee.

8.  Voucher Artifact

   The Voucher's primary purpose is to securely assign a Pledge to an
   Owner.  The Voucher informs the Pledge which entity it should
   consider to be its Owner.

   This document defines a Voucher Artifact that is a CMS-signed
   encoding of the JSON-encoded Voucher Data as defined by the YANG
   module Section 8.3.  Also, this document defines Voucher Data that is
   CBOR-encoded based on the same YANG model.  The CBOR-encoded (signed)
   Voucher based on this CBOR Voucher Data is defined in [cBRSKI].

   The Voucher Data format is described here as a practical basis for
   some uses (such as in NETCONF), but more to clearly indicate what
   Vouchers look like in practice.  This description also serves to
   validate the YANG data model.

   [RFC8366] defined a media type and a filename extension for the CMS-
   encoded JSON type.  The media type for JOSE format Vouchers is
   defined in [jBRSKI] and the media type for COSE format Vouchers is
   defined in [cBRSKI].  Both include respective filename extensions.

   The media type is used by the Pledge (requesting to the Registrar)
   and by the Registrar (requesting to the MASA) to signal what Voucher
   format is expected.  Other aspects of the Voucher, such as it being
   nonceless or which kind of pinned anchor is used, are not part of the
   media type.

   Only the format of Voucher that is expected is signaled in the form
   of a (MIME) media type in the HTTP "Accept" header [RFC9110].

   For Vouchers stored/transferred via methods like a USB storage device
   (USB key), the Voucher format is usually signaled by a filename
   extension.

8.1.  Tree Diagram

   The following tree diagram illustrates a high-level view of a Voucher
   document.  The notation used in this diagram is described in
   [RFC8340].  Each node in the diagram is fully described by the YANG
   module in Section 8.3.  Please review the YANG module for a detailed
   description of the Voucher format.

8.2.  Examples

   This section provides Voucher Data examples for illustration
   purposes.  These examples conform to the JSON encoding rules defined
   in [RFC8259].

   The following example illustrates an ephemeral Voucher (uses a
   nonce).  The MASA generated this Voucher using the 'logged' assertion
   type, knowing that it would be suitable for the Pledge making the
   request.

   {
     "ietf-voucher:voucher": {
       "created-on": "2016-10-07T19:31:42Z",
       "assertion": "logged",
       "serial-number": "JADA123456789",
       "idevid-issuer": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "pinned-domain-cert": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "nonce": "base64encodedvalue=="
     }
   }

   The following example illustrates a non-ephemeral Voucher (containing
   no nonce, or "nonceless").  While the Voucher itself expires after
   two weeks, it presumably can be renewed for up to a year.  The MASA
   generated this Voucher using the 'verified' assertion type, which
   should satisfy all Pledges.

   {
     "ietf-voucher:voucher": {
       "created-on": "2016-10-07T19:31:42Z",
       "expires-on": "2016-10-21T19:31:42Z",
       "assertion": "verified",
       "serial-number": "JADA123456789",
       "idevid-issuer": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "pinned-domain-cert": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "domain-cert-revocation-checks": true,
       "last-renewal-date": "2017-10-07T19:31:42Z"
     }
   }

   The final two examples illustrate a Voucher that includes an
   (example) extension per Section 8.5.  The hypothetical YANG module
   name of the extension is "example-my-extension".  First, a JSON
   serialization is shown.

   {
     "ietf-voucher:voucher": {
       "created-on": "2016-10-07T19:31:42Z",
       "assertion": "logged",
       "serial-number": "JADA123456789",
       "idevid-issuer": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "pinned-domain-cert": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "nonce": "base64encodedvalue==",
       "extensions": ["example-my-extension"],
       "extension:example-my-extension": {
         "my-ext-leaf1": "my-ext-leaf1-data"
       }
     }
   }

   Next, a CBOR serialization is shown in CBOR diagnostic notation.
   This uses again the extension module 'example-my-extension' and
   refers to it using its SID value 305823299950.  Note that for this
   example, long binary strings are abbreviated using the ellipsis (...)
   notation.

   {
     2451: {                          / ietf-voucher:voucher  /
       2:  "2016-10-07T19:31:42Z",    / created-on            /
       1:  1,                         / assertion (logged)    /
       11: "JADA123456789",           / serial-number         /
       5:  h'04183016 ... 1736C3E0',  / idevid-issuer         /
       8:  h'30820122 ... 12328CFF',  / pinned-domain-cert    /
       7:  h'831D5198A6CA2C7F',       / nonce                 /
       17: [305823299950],            / extensions            /
       47(305823299950): {            / example-my-extension  /
         1: "my-ext-leaf1-data"       / my-ext-leaf1          /
       }
     }
   }

   [jBRSKI], Section 8 contains examples of Vouchers encoded in JSON,
   and signed with [JWS]. [cBRSKI], Section 9 contains examples of
   Vouchers encoded in CBOR, and signed with [COSE].

8.3.  YANG Module

   During development of this merged YANG module, advice was given to
   better organize mutually exclusive Attributes such as 'pinned-domain-
   cert' vs 'pinned-domain-pubk', or 'expires-on' vs 'nonce'.
   Unfortunately, [CORESID] does not explain how and why choice
   statements are assigned SID values, and the tooling as of the end of
   2025 is inconsistent with both the document, and the intuitive
   notions as to how this should work.  As the simplest way forward, the
   choice mechanisms that were introduced have been commented out in the
   YANG, allowing the SID values to be generated correctly.  As a
   result, the SID values presented in Section 8.4 and Section 9.3 are
   to be considered normative, rather than relying exclusively on the
   ".sid" file [CORESID] generated from the YANG modules.  The presented
   SID values are believed to be correct, but future reprocessing of the
   YANG module to a ".sid" file could result in changes as the tooling
   is fixed.  Any such changes will be recorded as errata on this
   document.

8.4.  ietf-voucher SID values

   [RFC9254] explains how to serialize YANG into CBOR, and for this a
   series of SID values are required.  The below SID values are assigned
   to the 'ietf-voucher' YANG module elements and are considered
   normative.

   The right column shows the XPath expression for the YANG data node to
   which the SID value is assigned.  In the XPath, the ellipsis (...)
   notation is used to abbreviate the structure path '/ietf-
   voucher:voucher' to let each entry fit on one line.

   The 'assertion' Attribute is an enumerated type in [RFC8366], but no
   values were provided as part of the enumeration.  This document
   provides enumerated values as part of the YANG module.

   In the JSON serialization, the literal strings from the enumerated
   types are used so there is no ambiguity.

   In the CBOR serialization, a small integer is used, and the
   enumeration values are repeated here for convenience.  However, the
   YANG module should be considered authoritative.  No IANA registry is
   provided or necessary because the YANG module (and this document)
   would be extended when there are new entries required.

8.5.  Voucher Extensions

   An unstated assumption in [RFC8366] was that Vouchers could be
   extended in proprietary ways by manufacturers.  This allows for
   manufacturers to communicate new things from the MASA to the Pledge,
   and since both are under control of the same entity, it seemed
   perfectly fine, even though it would violate the strict definition of
   the YANG model.

   The JSON serialization of Vouchers implicitly accomodates the above,
   since the Voucher is just a map (or dictionary).  Map keys are just
   strings, and creating unique strings is easy to do by including the
   manufacturer's DNS domain name.

   In CBOR serialization [RFC9254], the situation is not so easy when
   SID keys are used.  An extension might need to use "Private range"
   [CORESID] SID values, or acquire SID values for their own use.

   Where the process has become complex is when making standard
   extensions, as has happened recently, resulting in this document.
   The processes which were anticipated to be useful (the YANG "augment"
   mechanism), turned out not to be, see Section 5.1.

   Instead, a process similar to what was done by [RFC8520] has been
   adopted.  In the Voucher Data, any extensions are listed in a list
   Attribute named 'extensions'.  In JSON serialization, these
   extensions each require a unique name, and therefore this name MUST
   be allocated by IANA.  The name MUST be the same as the YANG
   extension module name.  The 'extensions' list Attribute allows for
   new standard extensions to be defined without changes to the 'ietf-
   voucher' YANG module.  Items within that list are either strings (in
   JSON serialization), or integers (in CBOR serialization using SIDs);
   both are always defined in the entries of the Voucher Extensions
   Registry (see Section 12.5).

   Extensions are full YANG modules, which are subject to the SID
   allocation process described in [RFC9254].  When an extension is
   serialized, the extension is placed in a sub-map in the value of a
   new key/value pair in the 'voucher' container element.  In JSON
   serialization, the corresponding key is the name of the extension,
   prefixed by the string "extension:".  In CBOR serialization, the
   corresponding key is the SID which is allocated as the YANG extension
   module SID.  This will typically require the absolute SID value
   Tag(47) to be applied to this key (see Section 4.2.1 of [RFC9254] or
   the final example in Section 8.2).

   Note that this differs from the mechanism described in [RFC8520]:
   there, a sub-map is not used.  Instead, keys are created by combining
   the module name and the Attribute as a string, as a result of using
   the YANG "augment" mechanism.  The [RFC8520] mechanism uses more
   bytes, but is also not easily translatable to CBOR.

   As the Voucher Request YANG module is created by YANG augment of the
   Voucher YANG module, any extension defined for the Voucher is also
   valid for a Voucher Request.

8.6.  Manufacturer Private Extensions

   A manufacturer might need to communicate content in the Voucher (or
   in the Voucher Request), which are never subject to standardization.
   While they can use the Voucher extensions mechanism defined in
   Section 8.5, it does require allocation of a SID value in order to do
   minimal-sized encoding in case of CBOR Voucher Data.  Note that
   [RFC9254] does not strictly require use of SIDs: instead of a SID
   value, the full string name can always be used.  But this would
   significantly increase the size of the Voucher Data.

   Instead, a manufacturer MAY use the 'manufacturer-private' Attribute
   to put any content they wish.  In CBOR serialization, if a plain CBOR
   map would be used, it would be subject to delta encoding: so use of
   this Attribute requires that the contents are bstr-encoded [CBOR]
   [RFC8949], Section 3.1 (Major type 2).  In JSON serialization, delta
   encoding does not get in the way, and the manufacturer MAY use any
   encoding that is convenient for them, but base64URL encoding
   [RFC4648], Section 5 is RECOMMENDED.

9.  Voucher Request Artifact

   [BRSKI], Section 3 defined a "voucher-request" Artifact as an
   augmented Artifact from the "voucher" Artifact originally defined in
   [RFC8366].  That definition has been moved to this document, and
   translated from the "yang-data" extension [RFC8040] to the
   "sx:structure" extension [RFC8791].

   The following tree diagram illustrates a high-level view of a Voucher
   Request document.  The notation used in this diagram is described in
   [RFC8340].  Each node in the diagram is fully described by the YANG
   module in Section 9.2.

9.3.  ietf-voucher-request SID values

   [RFC9254] explains how to serialize YANG into CBOR, and for this a
   series of SID values are required.  The below SID values are assigned
   to the 'ietf-voucher-request' YANG module elements and are considered
   normative.

   The right column shows the XPath expression for the YANG data node to
   which the SID value is assigned.  In the XPath, the ellipsis (...)
   notation is used to abbreviate the structure path '/ietf-voucher-
   request:voucher' to let each entry fit on one line.

   The 'assertion' Attribute is an enumerated type, and has values as
   defined in Table 2.

10.  Design Considerations

10.1.  Renewals Instead of Revocations

   The lifetimes of Vouchers may vary.  In some Onboarding protocols,
   the Vouchers may be created and consumed immediately, whereas in
   other Onboarding solutions, there may be a significant time delay
   between when a Voucher is created and when it is consumed.  In cases
   when there is a time delay, there is a need for the Pledge to ensure
   that the assertions made when the Voucher was created are still
   valid.

   A revocation artifact is generally used to verify the continued
   validity of an assertion such as a PKIX certificate [RFC5280], web
   token, or Voucher.  With this approach, a potentially long-lived
   assertion is paired with a reasonably fresh revocation status check
   to ensure that the assertion is still valid.  However, this approach
   increases solution complexity, as it introduces the need for
   additional protocols and code paths to distribute and process the
   revocations.

   Addressing the shortcomings of revocations, this document recommends
   instead the use of lightweight renewals of short-lived non-revocable
   Vouchers.  That is, rather than issue a long-lived Voucher, where the
   'expires-on' Attribute is set to some distant date, the expectation
   is for the MASA to instead issue a short-lived Voucher, where the
   'expires-on' Attribute is set to a relatively near date, along with a
   promise (reflected in the 'last-renewal-date' Attribute) to reissue
   the Voucher again when needed.  Importantly, while issuing the
   initial Voucher may incur heavyweight verification checks ("Are you
   who you say you are?"  "Does the Pledge actually belong to you?"),
   reissuing the Voucher should be a lightweight process, as it
   ostensibly only updates the Voucher's validity period.  With this
   approach, there is only the one Artifact, and only one code path is
   needed to process it; there is no possibility of a Pledge choosing to
   skip the revocation status check because, for instance, the OCSP
   Responder ([RFC5280]) is not reachable.

   While this document recommends issuing short-lived Vouchers, the
   Voucher Artifact does not restrict the ability to create long-lived
   Vouchers, if required; however, no revocation method is described.

   Note that a Voucher may be signed by a chain of intermediate CAs
   leading up to the trust anchor CA known by the Pledge.  Even though
   the Voucher itself is not revocable, it is still revoked, per se, if
   one of the intermediate CA certificates is revoked.

10.2.  Voucher Per Pledge

   The solution described herein originally enabled a single Voucher to
   apply to many Pledges, using lists of regular expressions to
   represent ranges of serial numbers.  However, it was determined that
   blocking the renewal of a Voucher that applied to many devices would
   be excessive when only the ownership for a single Pledge needed to be
   blocked.  Thus, the Voucher format now only supports a single serial
   number to be listed.

11.  Security Considerations

11.1.  Clock Sensitivity

   An attacker could use an expired Voucher to gain control over a
   device that has no understanding of time.  The device cannot trust
   NTP as a time reference, as an attacker could control the NTP stream.

   There are three things to defend against this: 1) devices are
   required to verify that the 'expires-on' Attribute has not yet
   passed, 2) devices without access to time can use nonces to get
   ephemeral Vouchers, and 3) Vouchers without expiration times may be
   used, which will appear in the audit log, informing the security
   decision.

   This document defines a Voucher format that contains time values for
   expirations, which require an accurate clock in order to be processed
   correctly.  Vendors planning on issuing Vouchers with expiration
   values must ensure that devices have an accurate clock when shipped
   from manufacturing facilities and take steps to prevent clock
   tampering.  If it is not possible to ensure clock accuracy, then
   Vouchers with time values for expirations should not be issued.

11.2.  Protect MASA Signing Key in HSM

   Pursuant to the recommendation made in Section 6.1 for the MASA to be
   deployed as an online Voucher signing service, it is RECOMMENDED that
   the MASA's private key used for signing Vouchers is protected by a
   hardware security module (HSM).

11.3.  Test Domain Certificate Validity When Signing

   If a Domain certificate is compromised, then any outstanding Vouchers
   for that Domain could be used by the attacker.  In this case, the
   Domain administrator is clearly expected to initiate revocation of
   any Domain identity certificates (as is normal in PKIX [RFC5280]
   solutions).

   Similarly, they are expected to contact the MASA to indicate that an
   outstanding (presumably short lifetime) Voucher should be blocked
   from automated renewal.  Protocols for Voucher distribution are
   RECOMMENDED to check for revocation of Domain identity certificates
   before the signing of Vouchers.

11.4.  YANG Module Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define the schema for
   data that is subsequently encapsulated by secure signed-data
   structures, such as the CMS signed-data described in Section 7.1.  As
   such, all of the YANG-modeled data is protected from modification.

   Implementations should be aware that the signed data is only
   protected from external modification; the data is still visible.
   This potential disclosure of information doesn't affect security so
   much as privacy.  In particular, adversaries can glean information
   such as which devices belong to which organizations and which CRL
   Distribution Point and/or OCSP Responder URLs are accessed to
   validate the Vouchers.  When privacy is important, the CMS signed-
   data content type SHOULD be encrypted, either by conveying it via a
   mutually authenticated secure transport protocol (e.g., TLS
   [RFC8446]) or by encapsulating the signed-data content type with an
   enveloped-data content type (Section 6 of [RFC5652]), though details
   for how to do this are outside the scope of this document.

   The use of YANG to define data structures, via the "sx:structure"
   extension [RFC8791], is relatively new and distinct from the
   traditional use of YANG to define an API accessed by network
   management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  For this reason, this security considerations section
   does not follow the template described by Section 3.7 of
   [YANG-GUIDE].

12.  IANA Considerations

12.1.  The IETF XML Registry

   This document updates two URIs in the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].

   IANA has registered the following based on [RFC8366] and [BRSKI]
   respectively:

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-voucher
      Registrant Contact:  The ANIMA WG of the IETF.
      XML:  N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-voucher-request
      Registrant Contact:  The ANIMA WG of the IETF.
      XML:  N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   For both entries, the reference should be updated to point to this
   document.

12.2.  The YANG Module Names Registry

   This document updates two entries in the "YANG Module Names" registry
   [RFC6020].

   IANA has registered the following based on [RFC8366]:

      name:  ietf-voucher
      namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-voucher
      prefix:  vch
      reference:  RFC 8366

   This reference should be updated to point to this document and the
   "File" entry should be updated to point to the new module revision in
   Section 8.3.

   IANA has registered the following based on [BRSKI]:

      name:  ietf-voucher-request
      namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-voucher-request
      prefix:  vch
      reference:  RFC 8995

   This reference should also be updated to point to this document and
   the "File" entry should be updated to point to the new module
   revision in Section 9.2.  Additionally, the "prefix" field should be
   updated as follows:

      prefix:  vcr

12.3.  The Media Types Registry

   IANA has registered the media type: application/voucher-cms+json, and
   this registration should be updated to point to this document.

12.4.  The SMI Security for S/MIME CMS Content Type Registry

   IANA has registered the OID 1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1.40, 'id-ct-
   animaJSONVoucher'.  This registration should be updated to point to
   this document.

12.5.  The Voucher Extensions Registry

   IANA is asked to create a registry of Voucher extensions as follows:

      Registry name:  Voucher Extensions Registry
      Registry policy:  First Come First Served
      Reference:  an optional document
      Extension name:  UTF-8-encoded string, not to exceed 40
         characters.
      Extension SID:  the YANG module SID value that defines the
         extension per Section 8.5.

   Each extension MUST follow the rules specified in this specification.
   As is usual, the IANA issues early allocations in accordance with
   [RFC7120].

   Note that the SID module value is allocated as part of a [CORESID]
   process.  This may be from a SID range managed by IANA, or from any
   other MegaRange.  Future work may allow for PEN based allocations.
   IANA does not need to separately allocate a SID value for this
   column.

   Extension name strings for standards track documents are single
   words, given by the YANG Module Name.  They do not contain dots.  For
   vendor proprietary extensions, the string SHOULD be made unique by
   putting the extension name in the form a fully-qualified domain name
   (FQDN) [RFC3696], such as "fuubar.example.com"

   Vendor proprietary extensions do not need to be registered with IANA,
   but vendors MAY do so.

   Designated Experts should review for standards track documents for
   clarity, but the process is essentially tied to WG and IESG process:
   There are no choices in the extension names (which is always the YANG
   module name), or SID value (which is from another IANA process).  For
   non-standards track extensions, the Designated Expert should review
   whatever document is provided, if any.  The stability of the
   reference may be of concern.  The Designated Expert should determine
   if the work overlaps with existing efforts; and if so suggest
   merging.  However, as registration is optional, the Designated Expert
   should not block any registrations.
