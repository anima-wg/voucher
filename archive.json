          "body": "1. When Kent was not present, i voiced the opinion to max that logically all fields could be optional because the sender knows what the receiver needs. But i can see Kents point which i think is to keep the model semantically \"strong\". If we make everything optional and do not even define whether something is a request or an actual voucher, and what element is optional where, then all verification has to be based on context including where on a wire the object is seen, and implementations can much easier make mistakes. That would not be good.\r\n\r\n2. Given how the idea of the voucher-request came in fairly late in the process and we are in last call, i think we should concede that we may not be able to resolve all voucher-request related issues without causing unnecessary delay to the voucher document. I would suggest we\r\n\r\n2.a) keep the text suggestion that voucher \"could\" be used for voucher-request (just one sentence). Even if (see below) we may not use solely the voucher.\r\n2.b) Make sure that mandatory definitions and descriptive text is correct for vouchers (not voucher requests).\r\n2.c) If we have any descriptive text in the yang model that was added specifically for the voucher request, we should explicitly say so , else its confusing.\r\n\r\n3. I have no problems creating a derived voucher format in the BRSKI document that adds a voucher-request container as an alternative to the voucher container if we see that the MUST statements in the voucher document would make workarounds (\"fill in with fake values\") would look too gross to us. \r\n\r\nThe BRSKI voucher-artifact would then be an extended version of the voucher-artifact and be fully backward compatibe: exactly the same for vouchers, just adding voucher-requests. The only non-ideal thing resulting out of this is that we would have to duplicate all the voucher elements into a voucher-request container (to change MUST/optional). But at least we do not need to duplicaet the voucher container (grouping takes care of that). But i would be very happy: It is syntactically strong and explicit, and i can also complain about YANG being a lame language that doesn't allow me to do this easier than through duplication ;-)\r\n\r\n4. If all the above makes sense, i am not quite sure if any of Max'es concerns till need to be resolved, because they look primarily like issues for requests.",

          "body": "`After` an earfull of YANG from colleagues and reading rfc8040:\r\n\r\nYANG grouping defines just a template. If you want to use it in any place you need to instantiate it first. Its meant for reuse. Grouping are great if you want to reuse definitions. Consider a yang object you need in the config store and in the operations store, you simply instantiate the grouping twice.\r\n\r\nAugmentation is another specific YANG construct, but it is only meant to extend an already defined instance in a YANG tree. like some 'bis' version of a module. If you want a derived variant of some tree it's better to first define a grouping and then instantiate the grouping twice with for example extension in the second grouping.\r\n\r\nIn the current voucher doc (Jun 27 - https://github.com/anima-wg/voucher/blob/7480341bf01fda153a80ea55b49811914e8315bc/draft-ietf-anima-voucher.txt), the word grouping is IMHO just a mistake leftover:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrc:yang-data voucher-artifact {\r\n...\r\n} // end voucher-grouping\r\n```\r\n\r\nvoucher-artifact is not a grouping but a YANG data template. Which means that the whole blob inside of it is not a YANG grouping (yang template) or a YANG data instance for any tree, but it is free floating structured message definition in YANG that you can use in any protocol. Aka: just what we need for Netconf and BRSKI.\r\n\r\nBUT: Because we use actually in Netconf and in BRSKI the voucher-artifact, we should be careful in BRSKI to also refer to the term \"voucher artifact\" and not just the \"voucher\". \r\n\r\nFor example. Consider an extension to the voucher artifact adding data that is not logically part of the voucher itself but that makes a lot of sense to be part of the voucher artifact (signed voucher blob):\r\n\r\n```\r\nrc:yang-data voucher-artifact {\r\n    container voucher {\r\n    }\r\n   leaf owner-bootstrap-server {\r\n       // ... string etc to carry a URL indicate method (netconf, BRSKI,...) and server name\r\n   }\r\n} // end of RFC8040 voucher YANG Data scheme\r\n\r\n```\r\nAka if you got a voucher on a USB stick you wouldn't need to have a separate signed file pointing you to your bootstrap server (registrar/zero-touch-netconf-server), but it could be co-signed into the voucher-artifact object - but clearly not necessarily part of the \"voucher\" itself.\r\n\r\nJust an example. With MASA  online we have other ways to signal the owner-bootstrap-server, BUT:\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could make the voucher-artifact extensible so that for example we could later on write an extended voucher-artefact draft that for example adds this bootstrap server.\r\n\r\nTo that extend, i don't think that the rc:yang-data YANG data schema definition is sufficient to make it easy to build such an extension.\r\n\r\nI think the following is hopefully the right YANG code to provide reuseability: \r\n\r\n```\r\nrc:yang-data voucher-artifact {\r\n    uses voucher-artifact-grouping ;\r\n} // instantiating the YANG DATA scheme \r\n\r\ngrouping voucher-artifact-grouping {\r\n    container voucher {\r\n        // contains all content of voucher\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then in a voucher-artefact extension document one could say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule ietf-voucher-extended {\r\n    import ietf-voucher {\r\n        prefix \"v\";\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  rc:yang-data voucher-artifact {\r\n      uses voucher-artifact-grouping\r\n  }\r\n\r\n grouping voucher-artifact-grouping {\r\n       uses v:voucher-artifact-grouping {\r\n           augment target/voucher {\r\n           leaf another-voucher-attribute {\r\n               // whatever\r\n           } \r\n       }\r\n       leaf owner-bootstrap-server {\r\n           // ... string etc to carry a URL indicate method (netconf, BRSKI,...) and server name\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis example shows:\r\n- you again do grouping so your extension could later be referenced in another document and extended there.\r\n- you inherit and instantiate the grouping from the original voucher draft (\"uses\")\r\n- You insert something into the existing structure (voucher) (augment)\r\n- you add something to the structure at the top level (owner-bootstrap-server), no augmentation needed.\r\n",

For RFC8366bis, these assertions comprise:\r\n\r\n- verified\r\n- logged\r\n- proximity\r\n- agent-proximity \r\n\r\nThe YANG module defines the assertions as statement from the MASA regarding **how the owner was verified**. This fits in general for verified and logged and describe the MASA \"trust\" into a potential customer domain. \r\nProximity (and agent-proximity) seems rather an assertion that attests that the pledge has seen the correct registrar, which can be attested by the MASA. The current YANG description does not explicitly relate to the ownership verification or supply chain integration for this assertion. \r\n\r\nThe MASA may provide a proximity assertion by verifying the relation of the Registrar Certificate in the PVR and the Registrar Certificate related to the RVR. This may be independent from the supply chain and the MASA may provide this assertion independent, if he has a direct connection to the customer or no connection to the customer if the pledge was sold via a distributor. \r\n\r\nThis may lead to the discussion of having two different assertions, one focusing on the ownership related status or the trust between the customer and the MASA (currently \"verified\" and \"logged\") and the second one for the relation of Pledge and Registrar in the customer domain (currently \"proximity\" and agent-proximity\"). \r\n\r\nIf both assertions are evaluated they may lead to different pledge behavior (e.g., a proximity assertion together with the supply chain integration information may lead to enable additional functionality of the pledge). Currently I don't have a dedicated use case in mind and would expect the pledge is reaction in a similar way. But having semantically different information as distinct assertions could help addressing future scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe trust between customer and MASA may be established in different ways:  \r\n- supply chain integration\r\n- customer registration at MASA \r\n- based on publicly trusted certificate of registrar in customer domain\r\n\r\nSee also [email discussion](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/anima/wuVBTBOXG8O7_kvzOTQgeWjqx7o/)",

          "body": "@stfries In the current design of the assertions, both aspects are combined into one.\r\n* \"logged\" means that the onboarding action (i.e. each issued voucher) is just logged with minimal validation. E.g. only validate that the Pledge is a genuine device and write the domain claiming its ownership into the log.\r\n* \"proximity\" means that proximity was verified and that the action is also logged like above.\r\n* \"verified\" means ownership was positively verified in some way, which the Pledge wouldn't need to care about how, just that it has been done successfully. In this case it's not needed to state \"proximity + verified\" I think, because \"verified\" alone should be all the Pledge needs to make its decision to accept the Voucher!\r\n\r\nSo \"proximity\" looks like a weaker variant than \"verified\".  For example if ownership is already validate through sales integration then the \"agent-proximity\" assertion would also not be used.\r\n\"verified\" includes also \"logged\" by definition, because the MASA would anyhow need to log the issued voucher. For tracability or to avoid issuing unlimited vouchers for the same device.\r\n\r\nTBH I don't see a need to split the assertion into two parts.  Or is there a specific reason to include the proximity information separately in the Voucher?\r\n\r\n> e.g., a proximity assertion together with the supply chain integration information may lead to enable additional functionality of the pledge\r\n\r\nIf the vendor has already \"verified\" the customer, and writes this in the Voucher , it means the Pledge can enable all its features that are intended for verified users. There should be no difference in functions if the Voucher would state \"verified + proximity\". If there are distinct features to be enabled for the target customer: vendor-specific fields with those features can be included in the Voucher and no need to use the assertion for that.\r\n\r\nMaybe I miss something here but I think the intended design was a single assertion that spans the spectrum from \"barely verified\" to \"fully verified\" and everything in between.  Any other feature selection can be placed in vendor-specific fields. See also the 8366bis text that says:\r\n\r\n> The MASA generated this voucher using the 'verified' assertion type, which should satisfy all pledges\r\n",

That way the pledge could get information where to find a configuration server in the registrar's domain. But this is just a thought.
